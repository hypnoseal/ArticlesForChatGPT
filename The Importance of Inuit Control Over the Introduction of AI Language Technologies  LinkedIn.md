Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Translations (MT) relate to the use of computational methodologies and neural networks – popularly referred to as Artificial Intelligence or AI systems – that perform various functions with human languages such as translations or speech and text recognition by computers. Examples of these technologies today include popular digital services such as Siri and Google Translate. Creating neural network models to train NLP and MT systems can greatly benefit organizations towards implementing computer-based human language systems rapidly around the world. Would NLP and MT technologies for Inuit languages benefit Inuit communities and organizations?

Inuit – people indigenous to the Arctic in the USA, Canada, Greenland and Russia – could benefit greatly from the creation of NLP and MT technologies that understand Inuit languages. Supporting the appropriation of language technologies for indigenous peoples of the North would support their inclusion within the global digital society and would reduce the digital divide related to language barriers. Inuit would also be better able to incorporate digital technologies within self-governance in their own language.

It must be noted, however, that outsiders have – over a period of a few hundred years – introduced technologies into the North with beneficial intentions that have, over time, caused extreme strife within Inuit communities. Much of these technological introductions have occurred without the informed consent of Inuit. On the flip side, Inuit society is remarkably adaptable and has incorporated new technologies to the significant benefit of their communities. The essential element between technologies having benefits or detriments for Inuit society rests on control over the technology.

Any new technology, where the control and full-comprehension of its functioning remains in the hands of outsiders, has the opportunity to further entrench colonialism in the North. In short, the Inuit could benefit from increased ability to use their own language within digital technologies but would remain bound to the technically advanced organizations introducing those technologies. This imbalance – or inequality – in technological control would create yet another challenge for Inuit self-governance amongst the many hurdles already being faced.

An important facet of technology governance within Inuit communities is to include Inuit in the development, planning and control from the very beginning. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   Consultations about implementing the technology in a culturally sensitive manner;
-   Including Inuit in the development of the technology and resources it requires;
-   Teaching and training Inuit on how the technology works and can be built upon or modified; and,
-   Respecting the wishes of Inuit communities that do not want the technologies introduced. 

NLP and MT for Inuit languages is a promising opportunity to help reduce the digital divide between Inuit communities and the global digital society. While it offers the possibilities to increase the use of digital technologies with Inuit languages, it also presents issues related to Inuit maintaining self-governance and control over technologies introduced into their communities. Maximizing the benefit of NLP and MT and reducing the risks associated with it for Inuit communities requires the inclusion of Inuit peoples from the very beginning.

Blockchain technologies are causing quite the stir in finance lately and have the possibility of significantly disrupting how we view finance or money in the near future. Although much attention is given to what blockchain can do for finance and markets, not as much attention is given to how corporate entities might benefit from the technology. This report aims to help fill that gap by exploring how to structure a blockchain-based corporate entity that has matching traditional corporate structures.

Before diving in, let’s visit some blockchain terms used in this article to assist the uninitiated in understanding what we will be talking about:

-   **Blockchain** – _Blockchain technologies are a system of record keeping that stores transaction, value and ownership data on a common ledger shared between a network of computers. In the future, blockchain technologies could be used in place of money, traditional accounting systems and governance frameworks. Blockchains can do these things by recording, storing and distributing information about transactions._
-   **Smart Contracts** – _Smart contracts can be considered as electronic contracts that are programmed to perform or control contractual obligations between any number of parties. Smart contracts can automate agreements, processes, transactions and much more. Two common programming languages for smart contracts are Solidity and Rust._
-   **Tokens** – _Tokens in a blockchain system are an abstract, digital representation of ownership over an asset, membership, or claim. Often stored in digital representations of wallets, a token can be used as currency—such as a coin or paper bill—or prove ownership over an entity—such as a share certificate. Two famous tokens include Bitcoin and Ethereum._

This report is purposefully blockchain technology agnostic and makes no suggestion of which technologies to implement on. There are a large number of competing blockchain technologies emerging, with more popping up daily. Thus, the report focuses on the governance, structural, ownership and operational considerations of blockchain-enabled corporations as a category, rather than focusing on implementing a corporation on a specific technology. Nonetheless, at the time of writing, the author's favourite blockchain technologies for accomplishing the following include: [Solana](https://solana.com/), [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), and [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/). Furthermore, there are a large number of blockchain projects which implement much of what is discussed below; in other words, the implementation and governance is the focus of the report because a broad array of technology options already exist today.

## Why Build a Blockchain-based Corporate Entity?

The corporate entity described in this report would be a blockchain and smart-contract based entity that has matching real world contracts, agreements and registrations allowing the entity to operate in both the traditional and blockchain environments. It would have the benefits offered by emerging blockchain technologies for business and governance while existing in the traditional market, regulatory and legislative paradigm.

For this example, the corporation will be digital and blockchain first then “paper” second. Although the aim is to create a mirrored and dual-paradigm, the digital efforts take precedence and the traditional institutional “paper” requirements are formed to fit the digital. By building the technology, materials, knowledge and expertise in order to exist in both worlds, this type of corporate entity could become the medium, apparatus and system that existing corporations or new businesses utilize to transition or evolve into a blockchain entity.

## Visual Concept of a Blockchain Corporate Entity

The following is a visual representation of the matching between the blockchain and traditional manifestations of a corporation:

## Ownership of a Blockchain Corporation

The corporate entity example has two types of owners which have important differences, attributes and purposes. These owners would be similar to the traditional corporation’s shareholders and are called the following:

1.  **Vote-Carrying Token (VCT) Owners**
2.  **Non-Vote Token (NVT) Owners**

An owner (or wallet) would be capable of owning both types of tokens. Depending on the regulatory requirements of the host jurisdiction of the corporation, there may be requirements to create mirrored share certificates and the appropriate legal documents to pair these certificates to the tokenized representation of ownership.

### Vote-Carrying Tokens (VCT)

Vote-Carrying Tokens (VCT) represents ownership of the blockchain corporation that has voting capacity in the management and governance of the corporate entity. In addition to voting capabilities, the VCTs have powers to view information not typically available, make proposals to be voted on and more capabilities to be determined as the corporation evolves. VCT owners also have all of the capabilities of NVT owners.

The founders or the corporate constitution may wish to place restrictions on who or what is allowed to own VCTs and limits on the number of VCTs that any single person or entity can own. Restrictions on ownership could be used to encourage a high quality of owner. Limits could be placed on the amounts of VCTs that can be owned to ensure that no single owner is capable of unduly holding unfair influence over the direction of the corporation. All limits and restrictions should be able to be modified through the approval of VCT owners as required.

### Non-Vote Tokens (NVT)

Non-Vote Tokens (NVT) represents ownership within the blockchain corporation that do not have any voting powers. These are more focused towards equity involvement and high-liquidity trading. NVT have significantly reduced ownership restrictions, compared to VCT, in order to enhance the liquidity and tradability of the token. There might be no limits on the amount of NVT that can be owned.

Having no vote, however, does not necessarily mean having no voice. VCT owners would be encouraged to listen to the interests of NVT owners in order to maintain increasing market values and returns for the corporation and its tokens. NVT could also be endowed with certain special capabilities, such as community participation and viewing certain information related to the corporation. These capabilities would be determined by the Board of Directors as approved by the VCT owners.

### Value and Ratios of Tokens

The value of tokens would, like most publicly traded corporations, be determined by the market. The initial sale value of tokens, by the corporation, could be set following typical valuation techniques.

The corporation may also wish to set a ratio between the number of VCT and NVT. For example, setting ten NVT for every VCT (10:1). If a VCT token is created then an amount equal to the ratio of NVT must also be created. This ratio can be determined and modified by VCT owners as required or as suggested by the Board of Directors.

### Token Dividends

Tokens would receive dividends as decided upon by the Board of Directors and approved by the VCT owners. Dividend returns from VCT should always be higher than NVT. The amount paid in dividends to VCT should be set at the same ratio as the difference between the number of VCT and NVT. So, for example, if there are 10 NVTs for every 1 VCT the dividend for VCT would be 10 times the amount paid to NVT.

Dividends would be automatically paid into the wallet that owns the tokens or—if indicated by the owner—a preferred dividend receiving wallet. The payment of dividends would also be recorded and provided to owners in a report to support the preparation of taxation documents by token owners.

### Trading & Token Marketplace

The corporation should maintain a marketplace for the sale and trade of tokens, or work with an existing marketplace or exchange to accomplish this task. Tokens should be developed in such a way that other compatible marketplaces will also be able to support the trade of tokens. Given the complexity of VCT ownership restrictions and verification requirements, it is likely that NVT would be able to be traded on other outside markets prior to VCT being able to. All freshly minted tokens should be sold from the corporation’s marketplace, unless cooperation with another marketplace has been decided upon in advance.

### Transfer (Trade) Fee on the Trade of Tokens

The corporate entity might consider charging a fee on the sale or transfer of tokens after the second transfer immediately following creation. In other words, no fee is applied if the sale is made from the corporation, but a fee is charged if the sale is made from a non-minting wallet. This transfer or trade fee would be charged exclusive of transaction fees of the network or marketplace. The corporate entity trade fee would be paid by the seller at the time of the transaction approval. The fee structure could be proposed as follows (in line with the ratios):

-   10% of the sale value per VCT.
-   1% of the sale value per NVT.

Revenue earned by the corporate entity from the sale or transfer fees would go to the general revenues of the corporation. However, the revenues from these fees would be expected to be put towards the smooth operation of the trading network, verification services and related functions.

### Fractional Ownership of Tokens

In most blockchain projects tokens can be purchased, owned and traded in fractional amounts. Given that ownership is represented by tokens in this corporate entity, the ownership of fractional amounts of tokens could be possible. Limits should probably be placed on the fractional sale of newly created tokens at the discretion of the Board of Directors as approved by the VCT owners.

In this example, the divisibility of NVT could match that of the Etheruem network which is currently 10^18. That is, a NVT can be divided, traded and owned in units up to 10^18 fractional tokens. The divisibility of VCT could be much less than NVT and, for example, be set at 10^4.

Capabilities endowed upon tokens (such as viewing sensitive information, voting or other participation) should also be limited to owners who meet minimum ownership amounts:

-   NVT capabilities enabled if the owner’s wallet contains a minimum of 1/10^6 NVT.
-   NVT capabilities enabled if the owner’s wallet contains any amount of VCT.
-   VCT capabilities enabled if the owner’s wallet contains 1/10^3 VCT.

Dividends, ownership and trade capabilities can be enabled regardless of the amount owned for any token. The voting weight of a token, if the minimum ownership amounts are met, would match the fractional amount owned. For example, one VCT is worth one vote, and 1/10^3 VCT is worth 1/10^3 votes. The same would apply to dividends paid to tokens.

## Blockchain Corporation Constitution

The corporate entity’s constitution is similar to—yet should not be confused with—a nation’s constitution. It is the principal agreement between token owners and the corporate entity itself, of which both are accountable to the constitution. The constitution lays out the fundamental ethics, purpose, roles and boundaries that the corporate entity is subject to and that token owners must follow when participating in the corporate entity. In essence, the constitution is the most important guiding principles for the corporate entity and should encourage only individuals or entities that agree with the principles to become token owners. Although the importance of the constitution in the entity is paramount, the principles should be broad enough and flexible enough to allow lower levels of agreements or contracts to prescribe the minutiae or to allow the corporate entity to evolve in order to better support its success or purpose.

Even though the corporate entity’s constitution is not carved into stone—in reality it would be a legal agreement and smart contract—the constitution should be considered as such. This primordial agreement should be so stable and difficult to modify that it is considered set in stone. It is not permanent ad infinitum, but should be considered sufficiently permanent. Given its permanence, authority and important, the creators of the corporate entity’s constitution should not be overly prescriptive or verbose in the elements they decide to include.

The constitution could exist in two formats:

-   First, as a smart-contract; and
-   Second, as a traditional “paper” agreement.

The smart-contract version of the constitution would be the primary authority that the corporate entity would follow and interact with. The traditional paper agreement would mirror the smart-contract with the appropriate legalese. The paper agreement exists solely for regulatory submissions and for the use in the court of law, if required.

An important consideration for the corporate entity’s constitution is that it be sufficiently abstract enough that changes in technology do not negatively affect it. The constitution should support the corporate entity in adopting or evolving with technologies and it should be sufficiently easy to reconstitute the constitution in any future unknown technology. For example, the constitution should fit and work across all technologies as such:

_Handshake/Verbal Agreement <-> Written Agreement <-> Electronic Agreement <-> Smart-Contract_

The smart-contract’s authority and influence could be exerted on the corporate entity in the following ways:

-   The constitution smart-contract holds the highest level of authority over all smart-contracts, any lower-level smart-contract would assume any global variables or functions from the constitution.
-   Elements that can be written in code (in other words, constitutional elements that can be programmed into the operations and functions of the entity) would be written as distinct functions or variables.
-   Elements that cannot be written in code (for example, certain ethical related rules) would have a system developed that allow Vote-Carrying Token owners or other authoritative body to vote on whether the constitutional element was broken and what the following actions to rectify the issue should be.

The traditional written agreement version of the constitution would have influence over the entity in the following ways:

-   Communicate and respond to government or regulatory authorities that are unable to utilize smart-contract technologies;
-   Be the primary agreement to settle disputes that must be resolved in a court of law that does not have the capacity to utilize the smart-contract as an authoritative agreement; and
-   Provide fancy sounding words and text to include in communications and presentations.

### Changing the Constitution

Modifying the constitution should be sufficiently difficult enough that the owners and corporate entity itself are confident that it would suit them throughout ownership and participation. Changing the constitution should require the agreement of all Vote-Carrying Token Owners (100% Quorum & 100% Approval) and perhaps include a vote of the Board of Directors as well.

### Example Constitutional Elements

Example constitutional elements could include the following illustrative examples that, described here in words, would also be converted wherever possible into code:

-   _The corporate entity shall conduct itself in such a way that the sense of freedom, happiness and human dignity within the entity is maximized without the loss of profitability._
-   _The corporate entity will operate in a manner that is generally acceptable to the private sector of industry in the markets that the corporate entity participates in._
-   _The corporate entity shall limit is voting ownership to \[INSERT #\] persons or entities. If for some reason, the ownership must expand the corporate entity will conduct itself towards the creation of another entity to take over that reason._
-   _The renumeration for work within the corporate entity, between the lowest paid and the highest paid, shall never exceed the range of 1:10 before taxes. In other words, the highest paid work shall never be paid more than ten times the amount paid for the lowest paid work._
-   _The corporate entity will remain ignorant of nor favour any sex, creed, nationality, race, or religion in its conduct unless absolutely required by law._
-   _The owners of the corporate entity cannot for any reason dismiss another owner or eliminate another owner’s share in the entity. An owner however can discharge of their own ownership at any time for any reason._
-   _The weight of a voting owner’s vote or say in the affairs of the corporate entity will match the relative stake of voting-level ownership that that owner has in the corporate entity._
-   _The corporate entity shall never participate with, support or sell to any other entity known to engage in the genocide of peoples or cause harm to any person’s human rights._
-   _The Board of Directors, the corporate entity’s employees or contractors and any agreement or contract within the corporate entity shall be subject to and accountable to the corporate entity’s constitution while participating, working or otherwise engaging in or with the corporate entity._

### Other Corporate Entity Agreements, Contracts and By-Laws

A lower-level agreement, below the corporate entity’s constitution, should be utilized wherever possible and appropriate to set conditions, rules, procedures etc.

**Shareholders Agreement**

A token smart-contract and mirrored shareholders agreement should be the preferred method of setting up token and owner related things. Such as:

-   Rules related to the sale and transfer of ownership.
-   Which tokens have voting rights.
-   Limits on who or what can be owners.
-   Limits on the amount of ownership per individual or entity.
-   Reporting requirements from the Board of Directors to the VCT Council.

**Corporate By-Laws**

A By-Law smart-contract and mirrored Corporate By-Laws should be the preferred method of indicating and controlling the conduct of the Board of Directors and the functional corporate entity. Such as:

-   Who or what can be a Board of Director member.
-   The structure of the Board of Director Roles.
-   Reporting requirements for senior management.
-   Setting the corporate mission or business lines.

## Owners, Boards & Roles

There are three types of participants within the governance structure of this example corporate entity:

-   **VCT Council (Vote-Carrying Token Owners)**
-   **Board of Directors Members**
-   **Corporate Entity Roles**

Roles within the VCT Council, Board of Directors and corporate entity should be paid roles due to the work required. Renumeration form and amount would be determined based on the role, value to the corporate entity, the difficulty of work performed, etc. However, remuneration should endeavour to be task-based wherever possible.

### Vote-Carrying Token Owners and the VCT Council

Vote-Carrying Token (VCT) Owners represent the individuals or entities that own a stake in the corporate entity through the form of Vote-Carrying Tokens. VCT Owners are analogous to the concept of shareholders in a traditional corporation. The combined body of VCT Owners who have voting powers within the corporate entity are called the **VCT Council**. Membership on the VCT Council is automatic, if an individual or entity owns the minimum amount of VCT Tokens required for voting powers they are considered a member of the VCT Council. The VCT Owners and VCT Council are accountable to the corporate entity’s constitution.

**VCT Council Roles**

These roles perform the necessary activities to ensure the smooth operation of the VCT Council and the proposal and voting processes. VCT Council roles are analogous to the positions within a shareholders meeting, which include:

-   Chairperson
-   Vice-Chairperson
-   Secretary
-   Treasurer

VCT Council Roles are nominated by VCT Council members and appointments are made by voted in by the VCT Council. Term limits and revocations apply to these roles.

### Board of Directors

Members of the Board of Directors are individuals, entities or algorithms appointed by the VCT Council that perform a large number of important decision-making for the successful growth, profitability and operation of the corporate entity. The Board of Directors has a wide range of decision-making powers over the corporate entity as delegated by the VCT Council. Board members are analogous to the directors of a traditional corporation and the combined body of board members is called the **Board of Directors**. The board members and the Board of Directors are accountable to the VCT Council, the Constitution and the Corporate By-Laws.

Membership to the Board of Directors is accomplished through a nomination and voting process. Existing members of the Board of Directors or VCT Owners may nominate any individual, entity or algorithm to the Board of Directors. Appointment of nominations to the Board of Directors is accomplished through vote within the VCT Council. A Board Member is not required to be a VCT Owner, but a VCT Owner is allowed to be on the Board of Directors. Membership within the Board of Directors is subject to term limits and revocations.

**Board of Directors Roles**

These roles perform the necessary activities to ensure the smooth operation of the Board of Directors. Board of Directors roles are analogous to the traditional Board of Directors within a traditional corporation, which include:

-   President
-   Vice-President
-   Secretary
-   Treasurer
-   Director

Board of Directors Roles can be nominated by other Board of Directors members or the VCT Council members and are appointed into the position through vote within the VCT Council. Terms limits and revocations apply to these roles.

### Corporate Entity Roles

These roles conduct the actual day-to-day work of the corporate entity. They represent the management, development and operational activities necessary for the functioning of the corporate entity.

Corporate Entity Roles have a layered authority chain with the top layer being accountable to the Board of the Directors (including the VCT Council if so required) and each successive layer being accountable to the layer above it.

The initial layers of authority are likely to evolve and grow as the entity matures. For this example, the layers include:

-   Executive Management (CEO, CTO, COO, etc.)
-   Senior Management (Division Heads, Lead Managers, etc.)
-   Middle Management, Employees or Contractors
-   Further Levels as Required

_VCT Owners and Board of Directors members could also hold Corporate Entity Roles._

### **Visualizing the Governance Structure**

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E12AQGJannrXT1RGA/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1619447796459?e=1702512000&v=beta&t=IJFqNviAv17ozrRLxZaZezfFHlUh3UeVW7RncJ0WXLI)

## Decision-Making

Most activities within the corporate entity are related to decision-making, functions or a combination of both. The form and authority required for a decision or function is ultimately held by the VCT Council and/or the appropriate delegated authority. For the most part, decision-making within this corporate entity falls into two types:

1.  **Vote-based Decisions**
2.  **Role-based Decisions**

### Vote-Based Decision-Making

As the name implies, vote-based decisions are decisions made by a group through a vote. All decisions made at the VCT Council would be accomplished through a vote. Whereas, most decisions made at the Board of Directors level are made through voting. Although, decisions at the Board of Director’s level may be delegated to a role within the Board of Directors (ie. President or Secretary) for convenience. Some decisions at the Executive Management level and below may be accomplished via voting if the decision would benefit from this form of decision-making; an example being a working group or interdepartmental group, etc.

### Traditional Corporate Vote Decisions (Synchronous)

In a traditional organization the meetings for shareholders or the Board of Directors and the decision making that occurs at these meetings are typically synchronous. Synchronous decision-making often follows a structure similar to the following:

-   Quorum is made where a minimum number of members are present at the same time in the same location or through remote conferencing.
-   Prior minutes are approved and an agenda is followed which directs the topics to be discussed and voted upon.
-   Regular business items and operational matters of the group are reviewed, discussed and voted upon.
-   Motions are put forward by members to be decided upon.
-   Motions are seconded by another member.
-   Motions are then voted upon:
-   If a sufficient number of members vote in favour, the motion is approved. The number of members required for approval can vary depending on the motion put forward. In many cases a simple majority (>50%) of members is required to be in favour. In other cases, a different definition of majority may occur, being either higher or lower.
-   If an insufficient number of members vote in favour, the motion is denied. Some motions may be sent back to be reworked and put forward again at a future date (ie. perhaps something small needs to be tweaked to the motion). In other cases, the motion may be denied without any intention to reconsider the motion in the future.
-   The passing or failure of motions and related comments of members are recorded in the meeting minutes.
-   The meeting is adjourned typically by a motion of the members.

### Differences Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Vote-Based Decision-Making

Within an asynchronous organization, vote-based decision making occurs in a somewhat similar yet significantly different manner. Notably, the following differences exist:

-   A simultaneous meeting of members does not occur. Although members are not discouraged from meeting outside of the formal decision-making process.
-   Motions are made and voted upon as they come up outside of the context of a simultaneous meeting.
-   Greater amounts of time are afforded to members to consider, vote on or propose modifications to a motion.
-   Minutes and operational matters of the owners (shareholders) or Board of Directors are considered and approved outside of the context of a simultaneous meeting.

### Asynchronous Vote-Based Decision-Making Process

Blockchain technologies allow the corporate entity to utilize an asynchronous vote-based decision-making process instead of synchronous. The asynchronous vote-based decision-making process could occur in the following manner.

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQFNlLcTewXwRg/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1619445206898?e=1702512000&v=beta&t=qhIOJRRJF-3GD-u3PSrNG18Drjw7hxmAodIjpAsm9a0)

A member of a decision-making body may make a proposal at any time to the group in which they presently hold membership. Then a group, appointed person within the group (ie. chairperson or president), a predetermined rule, or an existing agreement sets the following requirements for the proposal:

-   **Quorum** - _The minimum number of members that must respond to the proposal in order for it to pass._
-   **Majority** - _The minimum number of members (of either the quorum or entire membership) that must respond in favour to the proposal in order for it to pass._
-   **Abstention Limit** \- _The maximum number of responses to a proposal where a member votes to abstain. If the maximum is exceeded the proposal fails._
-   **Identified or Anonymous Voting** - _Voting and submitting proposals may be anonymous or identified; however, they must be a member of the group in order to do so. In some cases, there could be a combination of anonymous and identified voting._
-   **Time Limit** - _The maximum amount of time that members have to respond to a proposal and for a proposal to meet the quorum requirement. Members can submit and modify their responses throughout the time limit period. Time limits should be sufficiently long enough to ensure that all members can participate and have enough time to consider and discuss the proposal._

Before the time-limit is reached, members of the voting group are encouraged to participate in the decision-making by:

-   Considering the proposal, appraising the arguments, reviewing any documentation and forming their decision toward approval or rejection.
-   Asking and responding to questions or interrogatories related to the proposal.
-   Discussing with and lobbying members to submit votes towards approval or rejection.
-   Submitting their vote for either approving or rejecting the proposal.
-   The weight, or value, of a vote could follow a wide variety of options, such as: one token, one vote (or, the relative fractional amount of token held by the owner); and, [quadratic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_voting) mechanisms (discussed in future article).

At the conclusion of the Time Limit the proposal passes or fails based on the following:

-   If an insufficient number of members respond to the proposal in order to meet the quorum, the proposal fails.
-   If quorum is met within the time limit, yet the majority requirement is not met then the proposal fails.
-   If quorum is reached within the time limit and the majority requirement is met then the proposal passes.

**_If the proposal passes_**, the appropriate organs of the entity would carry out the decision. For example, the appropriate developers would make the changes following the direction of executive management, etc. Some proposals may be changes to variables in existing smart-contracts which could be automated once a proposal passes.

**_If the proposal fails_**, the proposal is rejected. Some proposals may require modification or may want to never be reviewed again or it may have a specific timeout period. The voting mechanism should be robust enough to afford those who are voting to indicate, or for the appropriate appointed person to decide, whether a proposal should be allowed to be made again and when.

The results of all proposals (pass or fail) and any official comments submitted by voting members are recorded as Records of Decisions (RoDs) which include all of the official information regarding the proposal. These RoDs replace the traditional minutes of the synchronous meeting. RoDs can be viewed individually or summarized in various reports (temporal, theme, type, etc.) RoDs would always be stored on the blockchain.

**Components of a Proposal to be Voted Upon**

A proposal should include:

-   A relevant and related name.
-   A description.
-   Well-reasoned argumentation for a proposal option (multiple if multiple options).
-   Supporting documentation if required.
-   Submitting Authority (ie. VCT Council, Board Member or Role)

If a proposal is incomplete or if the name/description/argument/etc. are insufficient or inappropriate the proposal would be rejected. This would be a function of either:

-   For most proposals, the President, Chairperson or Sub-committee would perform this function. This could be considered similar to a moderator function.
-   Rules and contracts can dictate who performs this function for certain proposal types. For example, it may be most appropriate to have the Treasurer review financial related proposals.

**A Note on Proposal Voting Requirements**

Proposal requirements can be set through a variety of ways and a full-fledged organization would likely utilize multiple methods. In the example of this corporate entity, the proposal requirements could be determined as follows:

-   The constitution should have specific requirements written into it to ensure that any modification to the constitution must have those requirements met. Those requirements should be sufficiently high enough so that it is very difficult to change the constitution and all members of the VCT Council are in favour.
-   The Token Owners Contracts (Shareholders Agreement) should also like have sufficiently difficult requirements but not as difficult as the constitution.
-   Requirements for changes to the Corporate Entity By-Laws and Smart-Contract should set so that a clear majority of the Board of Directors is in favour and a clear majority of the VCT Council are also in favour.
-   Regular business approvals (ie. approvals of financial reports, business plans, etc.) at the Board of Director levels should likely have voting requirements that are rule-based and set in the By-Laws Smart Contract. An example would be the approval of the Annual Business Plan, which should have a rule-based requirement for efficiency and consistency.
-   Proposals that do not fit within a rule-based scheme or are not written into an agreement or contract should be set on a case-by-case basis where: the voting group sets the requirements; or the chairperson or president sets the requirements; or there exists a set of predetermined categories that indicate the requirements for the type of proposal made.
-   In the ideal governance, the group or board would appoint a trustworthy chairperson or president that would have the delegated authority to set the requirements for case-by-case proposals with the support of predetermined categories approved by the Board or Group.
-   The chair person or president would have term limits and also be subject to proposals for replacement for failure of duties. Any proposal for the expulsion of a president or chairperson should be written into the by-laws, agreements or smart contracts.

**Forking of Proposals**

Proposals can be “forked” by other voting members or those with delegated authority. This means that a voting member or delegated authority can submit a modified version of another proposal. Forking would allow for and support different options or viewpoints to be considered. Persons reading this report, who are familiar with the git versioning system, will recognize the similarities with "forking". Some considerations for a forked proposal within the corporate entity could include:

-   A forked proposal would have a matching time limit as the original proposal. The original and forked proposals would end at the same time.
-   A forked proposal’s quorum would add to and share the original proposal’s quorum. Since the voting members are considering the same issue with different voting options the quorum should be the same set of voters for the original and forked proposals.
-   The forking of a proposal may or may not modify the majority requirements of the proposal.
-   The abstention limit is cumulative for the original and forked proposals. That is, if enough members choose to abstain with their vote, all of the original and forked proposals fail.
-   There may be limits applied to the number of forks applied to a proposal.
-   The President or Chairperson, the members themselves or rules would be able to combine proposals so that proposal that are obviously forks of another proposal do not crowd the decision-making. They should also be able to reject forks if necessary.

**Ensuring Active Participation in the Asynchronous Voting Process**

A voting quota requirement could be placed on the Vote-Carrying Tokens in order to ensure the active participation of Vote-Carrying Token Owners. A wallet which holds Vote-Carrying Tokens would be required to submit a minimum number of responses to proposals over a defined period of time. This could be a combination of a percentage of proposals submitted over a given period of time and an absolute number of responses. If the voting quota is not met, the dividend or other benefits of the Vote-Carrying Tokens held in the wallet could be suspended until the quota is met again.

It is likely that an absolute number of proposal responses would be set to ensure participation in the regular business operations and to ensure smooth operations of the corporate entity (ie. approving annual reports). Further, a percentage quota should be set to ensure that Vote-Carrying Tokens participate in some proposals made by VCT Council members. Deadweight Vote-Carrying Tokens should never be allowed. Voting on the direction of the corporate entity is the purpose of Vote-Carrying Tokens and the dividend is paid handsomely to ensure this is achieved. Non-participating owners are better suited to NVT forms of ownership.

**Blockchain Proposal Voting System**

All voting could take place through something called the “_Blockchain Proposal Voting System_”. It could be thought of as a virtual, asynchronous meeting room.

The corporate entity would develop and operate an official proposal platform that interfaces with the Blockchain Proposal Voting System. Vote-Carrying Tokens could be encouraged to utilize this interface. However, the Blockchain Proposal Voting System should allow wallets to interact directly on the blockchain, or through an API, if so desired.

**Discussions Outside of the Proposal Voting Process**

The VCT Council may be encouraged to discuss and solicit proposal responses from other Vote-Carrying Token Owners through whatever medium they desire. However, the corporate entity should endeavour to provide a unified communications platform that is conducive to having these conversations and encouraging for VCT Owners to utilize. It is important to note, though, only the RoDs would be the official record (that being the proposals, the proposal meta-data, official comments submitted with the vote and the voting responses). Discussions outside of the Proposal Voting Process and RoD should never be considered official.

### Role-Based Decision-Making

It may be efficient, convenient or beneficial for some types of decisions to be delegated from voting authorities to a specific role or roles within the corporate entity. Role-based decisions should typically be operational in nature and never be broadly defined. Voting authorities would be able to delegate decisions through the proposal and voting process and also be able to rescind that authority through the same process. Role-based decision authorities should always be placed on a role within the corporate entity instead of on a specific person; this ensures the smooth transition of delegated authority if a person is replaced in a role.

Role-based decision making can be delegated to one or many roles. Role-based decisions can also be delegated to an algorithm. These roles could be from the VCT Council, Board of Directors, Executive Management, contractors, employees, etc. A role could hold any number of Role-Based Decision Authorities.

There would likely be a large assortment of role-based decisions within the corporate entity. Examples of role-based decision making could include:

-   An auditing function;
-   Non-executive level human resource decisions;
-   Taxation and accounting decisions;
-   Legal advising;
-   Preparation of reports and business plans;
-   Management of specific development projects; and
-   Much more.

A role-based decision maker should be allowed to submit “Requests for Direction” proposals to the appropriate voting authority (VCT Council, BoD or Executive, etc.) in order to solicit feedback on a decision. In some instances, a role may be able to submit proposals for decisions to the appropriate authority. For example, the CEO may request some direction from the BoD on an important section of a Business Plan, then once the draft is complete submit a proposal for the draft’s approval to the BoD.

It should be emphasized that a role-based decision authority should be well defined and highly circumscribed. These powers should be limited to their absolute necessity.

### Delegation

Since it would be inefficient and infeasible to place all decisions to be made by the corporate entity on the VCT owners, the VCT owners may delegate decision making authority to lower levels of the organization. For numerous types of decisions, those lower levels of authority may further delegate to even lower levels of the entity. Delegation of authority is always made to a role or function within the entity and never to a specific person.

The VCT Council would delegate and revoke authority for any function or decision-making to or from any level of the corporate entity, assuming the necessary quorum and majority requirements are met. Lower levels of authority in the entity may or may not be allowed to delegate authority to lower levels within the entity; the delegating authority can decide whether or not that delegated authority can be further delegated and how far that delegation can further proceed. The VCT Council would have the ultimate say in delegation of authority and the delegation chain.

**Delegation Levels**

Decision-making and functions within the entity hold different delegation levels which dictate whether that decision or function can be delegated, whether or not it can be delegated further and to what extent that delegation is allowed. The VCT Council would be able to set and change the delegation level for any function or decision, except for decisions related to the entity constitution which should forever be modifiable only by the VCT Council.

## Operations & Functions

### Operations

Operations simply refers to the day-to-day work that is accomplished within the corporate entity. This could include business development, technology development, marketing, bookkeeping, and much more. The corporate entity would be able to utilize innovative methods to accomplish much of this type of work required for a business by leveraging the capacities offered by blockchain technologies. Typically, operations should be considered as activities within the corporate entity that are not easily made routine nor can be automated. In other words, operations typically require human ingenuity or capacity with experience in order to accomplish.

Some examples of operations would include:

-   Drafting a business plan or preparing proposals for the VCT Council or BoD.
-   Developing blockchain technologies and systems.
-   Community development and nurturing.
-   Public and government relations.

### Functions

Functions within the corporate entity are activities that are normally routine, regular or common. They are different from decisions in that the functions already have the decision-making logic already decided. Functions are well suited for algorithms and should only utilize human effort when absolutely necessary. From a high-level, a function would be created and enacted in the following manner:

-   A corporate entity role or voting body would identify a need for a function.
-   The role(s) or appropriate body would agree upon the function logic and variables. (Development of the logic, variables and function could be delegated to a role.)
-   A corporate entity role would develop and put into place the new function.
-   The function would be tested.
-   The appropriate role(s) or voting body would approve the function for use.
-   The function would then be enabled and perform its purpose.

There could be a large number of functions in any entity and the first phases of developing an entity would require significant effort in creating the initial functions. Some example functions could include:

-   Payment processing
-   Sign-ups
-   Information gathering
-   Simple accounting
-   Producing documents or reports

### Methods of Fulfilling Operations & Functions

The operations and functions of the corporate entity could be accomplished through four main methods:

1.  Bounty
2.  Contract
3.  Employee
4.  Algorithm

**Bounties**

The corporate entity might wish to consider bounties to accomplish as many tasks—operations and functions—as it possibly can. Bounties are an effective method of accomplishing tasks without the need of hiring or contracting resources. This form of accomplishing tasks became popular in recent years in bug finding and issue fixing within the open-source software development community. However, bounty-based tasks can be applied to a much wider set of activities within the corporate entity than just software development.

Bounties can be applied in order to accomplish, but is not limited to:

-   Development, updates and fixes to systems and software.
-   Certain marketing materials (logos, texts, advertisements, etc.)
-   Research and reporting.
-   Sales.
-   Translations.

**Considerations for Creating Bounties**

In order for bounties to be successful, the following considerations should be applied when creating bounties:

-   Tasks should be discrete and well defined. Tasks should never be amorphous.
-   Tasks should be created in the smallest possible units, where projects or large tasks are broken apart as much as possible to create specific and discrete tasks.
-   Bounty rewards should be sufficiently valuable enough to attract the highest number of competitive and high-quality submissions.
-   Bounty rules and processes should be clearly described and openly available.
-   Bounty submissions should be available to team respondents and not just individuals. Bounty rewards should thus be able to be split amongst team members.
-   Bounty bonuses should be considered in cases when: a bounty submitter is a frequent or long-term task solver; numerous related tasks are submitted within a short-timeframe by a submitter; bounty tasks are solved rapidly; bounty responses are of exceptional quality; bounties are known to be difficult; or bounties have reappeared after having failed or expired.
-   Open bounties such as bug bounties or development proposals should be available.
-   Known bounty submitters should be eligible to submit suggestions for new or future bounties.
-   Bounty submitters’ identities should be known and verified following “Know Your Client (KYC)” type protocols. These identities do not necessarily have to be public, but internally the identities should be known for regulatory reasons.
-   Bounty rewards and renumeration could be paid in cryptocurrencies.
-   Bounty winners should acknowledge that the tax requirements of their jurisdiction applies and is their responsibility to follow.
-   Bounties should always have an end date, submission deadline or expiry date.
-   In some cases, it may be beneficial to limit bounty submissions to known submitters, submitters who have proven capabilities or perhaps a level-based achievement system.

**Bounty System**

Depending on the type, difficulty, importance, etc. of a task there may be different types of bounty rewards and options to consider. Different considerations for a bounty system include:

Simply Bounty

A simple bounty reward is a monetary amount paid to the first submission that meets all requirements of the bounty. This form of reward should be used when a task is clear cut, requirements are direct, and the work required is reasonably straightforward.

Multi-round Bounty

A multi-round bounty may be preferred when a task is highly complex, requirements are not as clear or choosing the winning solution or submission is subjective. Typically, a multi-round bounty would include one or more finalist rounds and a final winner round. An example of a multi-round bounty could include the following process:

-   “Bounty Hunters” submit solutions for the bounty task.
-   Submissions that meet the requirements within a certain timeframe and/or up to a limited number of submissions are awarded a submission bounty that is a small, yet non-trivial monetary amount. These submissions would be considered the finalists.
-   The choice of submissions into the finalist round could be performed by a project manager, a committee or an algorithm. The finalist bounty rewards should be high enough to elicit quality responses and reward submissions for being accepted as a finalist.
-   Of the finalists, the winning submission is chosen based on a variety of techniques depending on what the specific task of the bounty was.
-   The winning submission(s) should receive a significantly higher bounty reward than those received during the finalist round(s). Winner(s) would keep their finalist bounty rewards as well.

Winner selection processes could include:

-   A vote is held for the best or most appropriate submission by a committee, managers or higher-level authority. This process would be good for a subjective type of task such as marketing materials, graphic design, etc.
-   A technical expert, manager or selection committee chooses a winning solution that is either the best technical, innovative, best fitting, etc. This process would be useful in development situations or highly technical bounty tasks.
-   A community, such as clients, developers, the general public or stakeholders, choose through voting the winning submission. This could be useful for tasks that heavily affect clients, those related to community development or benefit from an outside opinion.

Multi-round bounty processes with increasing rewards provide the following benefits:

-   For complex or long-duration tasks, the submitter risks less for submitting work that is not chosen as the winner. If the submission makes it into a finalist round, but is not the winning submission, the effort put behind a submission is not wasted.
-   Finalist rounds, with finalist rewards set sufficiently high enough, could be considerable income for submitters and submission teams that participate and provide high quality results.
-   The valuable rewards encourage a broader range of submissions and greater competition.
-   Increases the odds of receiving numerous high-quality submissions for review.
-   Finalist submissions, if they fit the requirements in a future bounty, can be immediately selected as winner(s) in other bounties.

**Contracts & Contractors**

Contracting of services and resources should be the preferred method for tasks, functions, operations and management activities that do not fit within the bounty structure. Wherever possible, contracts should favour task-based or service-availability-based renumeration instead of time-based renumeration. Furthermore, acquiring commercial off the shelf solutions, infrastructure or software as a service and other commercial acquisitions should be considered and these should also prefer contracts.

The use of contracts would be useful in the following example situations:

-   For resources that require a high-level of trust, commitment and availability such as executive, management or support roles.
-   For professional services such as legal, accounting or auditing functions.
-   Service provision such as hosting/network services, 3rd party services or functions, software licensing and off-the-shelf services.

When contracting for a role internal to the corporate entity, the following form of contract could be considered:

-   A retainer (preferably monthly) to secure a given amount of availability and commitment of the resource. The higher the importance, the more available the resource must be and thus a higher retainer paid.
-   All known tasks that can be remunerated on a task-based method should be outlined and have an already agreed upon rate per task.
-   Certain positions, such as the executive or management resources, may require work to be accomplished that is not specified within the contract. These forms of “other work as required” clauses in the contract should be included and the renumeration for this clause should be included within the retainer.
-   Tasks that must remain hourly would have an agreed upon hourly rate with stringent reporting and time management requirements. Again, task-based should always be preferred to hourly-based and the task-based method of renumeration should be encouraged as the preferred renumeration method. Hour-based renumeration is highly inefficient, prone to abuse and difficult to accurately track; hourly forms of renumeration should be considered “the devil” of renumeration.
-   The calendar month should be the preferred renumeration period. For example, the tasks or hours accomplished during the month would be tallied at the month-end and the renumeration paid based on accomplishment. Retainers would be paid at the beginning of the monthly period.
-   Contracts with a retainer should include performance requirements with clearly laid out consequences for underperformance. Purely task-based contracts where the contracted resource is underperforming may be nullified.
-   All contracts should be encouraged towards high performance and accomplishment of tasks through bonuses. If a contracted resources meets or exceeds a task or quality goal then generous bonuses should be awarded.
-   Revocation of contracts for poor performance, acting in bad faith, negligence of duties or contradiction of the corporate constitution should be standard. The appropriate management level or voting body would hold these powers.

**Employees**

In this example, the corporate entity avoids as much as possible creating any employer-employee relationships with resources. Contracting is this entity’s preferred relationship over employment. Thus, all local laws and regulations where contracts or bounties are awarded should be considered in order to avoid undesirable employment rulings. Contracting should also be made sufficiently more lucrative than employment in order to encourage preference towards contractual relationships.

If for any reason an employer-employee relationship is unavoidable, the corporate entity should endeavour to be an honest, high paying, safe and respectable workplace. Furthermore, if a jurisdiction enacts regulations or legislation that make contracting or bounty based renumeration difficult or impossible then persons in those jurisdictions may be made ineligible from participation within the corporate entity.

**Algorithms**

An algorithm should be utilized in place of bounties, contracts or employees wherever possible and practical. That being said, the use of algorithms to perform complex or important tasks should be viewed realistically. Furthermore, if an algorithm is uneconomic—either due to development or operational costs—or cannot provide quality results, a human should be preferred. In short, there may be a resource available somewhere in the global market that is human powered that is significantly cheaper and have better results than an algorithm. Algorithms could be useful in the following situations:

-   Front-line customer interactions and support.
-   Routine data and text analysis.
-   Initial verification of identity and credentials.
-   Content moderation.
-   Continuous security monitoring, analysis and testing.

## Conclusion

This corporate entity is envisioned as being a blockchain-based entity that has matching traditional corporate structures and mechanisms. It captures the benefits offered by emerging blockchain technologies for business and governance while existing within the traditional market, regulatory and legislative paradigm. By building the technology, materials, knowledge and expertise in order to exist in both worlds, the corporate entity could become the medium, apparatus and system that existing corporations or new businesses utilize to transition or evolve into a blockchain entity. 

It creates a bridge between the operational, legal, regulatory, accounting and economic requirements of traditional, real-world organizations and incorporated entities with emerging blockchain technologies that support decentralization, asynchronous, digital, networked and “smart” capabilities. This entity could bring organizational governance, operations and ownership into the techno-economic paradigms of the 21st century with the vision of building future corporate models and paradigms that last.

Blockchain technologies are a system of record keeping that stores transaction, value and ownership data on a common ledger shared between a network of computers. In the near future, blockchain technologies could be used in place of money, traditional accounting systems and governance frameworks. Blockchains can do these things by recording, storing and distributing information about transactions.

When a transaction occurs on a blockchain it is recorded and placed inside a container called a “block”. When a block is filled with transactions, it is secured by cryptography and then linked to the previous blocks that came before it. Once linked, the blocks are immediately shared with all of the computers using the same blockchain network.

Cryptography, a form of mathematics, ensures that the data contained in any given block is permanent and cannot be changed without changing the entire blockchain. Each computer in the network knows what should be contained in the blockchain. As blocks are added, the computers in the network continuously verify that their blockchain matches the network’s. If something is wrong, the network is notified.

Some blockchains are able to lower risk, reduce failure points, require fewer resources and operate on less infrastructure than traditional systems.

However, blockchain technologies—and its related techno-economic paradigm—have not yet fully taken root in the corporate world because we live in a corporate paradigm where the leadership assumes one of three stances:

1.  Complete rejection of blockchain technologies in favour of traditional corporate structures and technologies.
2.  Misappropriation of blockchain technologies, by removing the main purposes of blockchain (centralized instead of decentralized, off-chain instead of on-chain, etc.) and attempt to form blockchain type technologies to fit the older, traditional corporate models.
3.  Complete rejection of traditional corporate structures and a radical focus on the fundamentals and idealisms of the blockchain ethos.

The reason for this occurring is the following:

> Institutional paradigms do not survive (or struggle to survive) through the changes brought about by new techno-economic paradigms.

This means that the institutional ways of doing things—in business, organizations and governments—are incompatible with the new ways. Compounding this, the _old guard_ recognizes—perhaps subconsciously—that they are on the way out and thus try hard to exert themselves. This continues to occur until some major event, such as a market crash, creates a shock that catapults the new techno-economic ways of functioning above and beyond the old ways.

We can see in the reaction of corporate culture towards blockchain the fairly typical responses to a new techno-economic paradigm. Respective to the three types of leadership responses to blockchain mentioned above:

1.  The first type consciously fights toward keeping the old institutional ways and techno-economic paradigm’s approaches of doing things. This is because they recognize that they hold power in the old techno-economic institutions and hold no power in the new. They’re fighting to maintain their power by attacking the new techno-economic paradigm.
2.  The second type recognizes that the new techno-economic paradigm is on the horizon. However, because they hold power in the old institutions or only have the knowledge of how to succeed in the old ways, these leaders try their hardest and spend considerable resources to form the new paradigm’s technologies and ways of doing things into the old ways. They’re trying to retain power by attempting to remodel the new techno-economic paradigm to fit the old way, which will not work-out in the long run.
3.  The third type are fully within the new techno-economic paradigm and hold power—however little in the current industrial scheme—within the new institutions that are beginning to form. These are typically young leaders who are early adopters of the new technologies and economic thinking. They are fanatical proponents of the new ways and are trying to disrupt or destroy the old institutions, which will leave a vacuum in its wake as the new institutions take time to spread its roots and grow.

Blockchain and corporate leaders—in order to find success today—should acknowledge how change occurs through techno-economic paradigms and the resulting impacts this change has on institutions. Leaders of the old institutions should see that new institutional ways of being are coming about and their organization should begin operating in the paradigm with the appropriate structures. Leaders of the new blockchain institutions should accept that the old paradigm continues to have its place in society.

These new blockchain leaders need to recognize that the existing institutional paradigms continue to remain in power and should create appendages within their blockchain solutions that fit neatly into the old paradigm. These appendages would act as a bridge between the old techno-economic paradigm and the new, so that those in power within the existing institutions can comfortably and easily transition into the new ways of being. This manner of thinking would better support the transformation of institutional power of the old techno-economic paradigm into a new techno-economic power.

Once the new techno-economic paradigm of blockchain becomes primary and the old institutional powers have transformed or been destroyed, these appendages that the organizations have nurtured to bridge itself to the old ways can be shed off or kept in a status that allows the trailing, older institutional powers to convert while they still can. The blockchain organization—because it first built itself a foundation in the new techno-economic paradigm—will be strong and will have benefited from the transformation of old institutional powers into new institutional powers.

This type of bridge between both techno-economic paradigms will allow organizations to create roots within the new techno-economic paradigm early on and focus its growth within it, while supporting the old powers toward transformation. By building appendages into the current (old) techno-economic paradigm it will also allow the organization to properly interact with and participate with the old institutions such as:

-   Corporations and markets holding strength in the old techno-economic paradigm;
-   Governments and their agencies whom are structured within the outgoing institutional ways, because governments are typically the last to convert; and
-   Investors, leaders, people and the general public who are interested in participating in and benefiting from the new techno-economic paradigm but do not yet have the capacity to do so.

In order to be the blockchain leaders of today and tomorrow, we should all consider this middle path as we transition from one way of working to another. By taking this middle path we will all be better able to build our organizations upon strong foundations while benefiting from the innovations occurring in the blockchain sphere.

FRAME is a smart-community development and innovation kit for businesses, governments and organizations that seek working technology solutions for immediate issues. It is meant to be an innovation ecosystem that supports the rapid development and deployment of smart-community solutions in difficult and hard-to-govern situations. The ecosystem provides an open-source environment, technology linkages, and development tools to ensure interoperability between solutions within a wide variety of context related requirements.

## FRAME - Functional Rapid Adaptable Modular Ecosystem

FRAME aims to assist in the adoption of technology solutions to support communities, governments and organizations in responding to a wide variety of contextual requirements. It will allow communities to find innovative solutions through technologies and to create new innovative solutions “on top” of the ecosystem. 

It is the belief of the creators of FRAME that it is the people on the ground, who are directly facing the issues in their own communities, that know how to best use the tools available to them to overcome challenges. Solutions to challenges cannot be dictated from a central decision-making body, instead the decisions - in the end - must be made by those persons who are directly utilizing technologies and benefiting from them. FRAME proposes a form of decentralized innovation with a combination of coordinated knowledge-sharing that allows for the greatest, longest lasting smart-community related innovations to be achieved in any context.

In the words of Friedrich Hayek (1945) in his article “_The Use of Knowledge in Society_”:

_“If we can agree that the economic problem of society is mainly one of rapid adaptation to changes in the particular circumstances of time and place, it would seem to follow that the ultimate decisions must be left to the people who are familiar with these circumstances, who know directly of the relevant changes and of the resources immediately available to meet them. We cannot expect that this problem will be solved by first communicating all this knowledge to a central board which, after integrating all knowledge, issues its orders. We must solve it by some form of decentralization. But this answers only part of our problem. We need decentralization because only thus can we ensure that the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place will be promptly used. But the "man on the spot" cannot decide solely on the basis of his limited but intimate knowledge of the facts of his immediate surroundings. There still remains the problem of communicating to him such further information as he needs to fit his decisions into the whole pattern of changes of the larger economic system.”_

### Purpose of FRAME

FRAME provides a unified innovation framework and ecosystem to support existing commercial or open-sourced technologies in working together to solve the requirements faced by governments, organizations and communities in a wide variety of contextual circumstances. Importantly, the environment does not aim to invent or deliver the various solutions within the ecosystem; instead, it aims to support its intended users in developing their own solutions that work best in their specific contexts, be it cultural, geographical, economic, political, etc.

Users of FRAME will be able to choose which smart-solutions are required within the specific context and will be provided the information or tools required to deploy the smart solutions needed. In order to be included in the FRAME environment, a solution will be required to meet certain technical specifications. These specifications will ensure that any technology solution can be: 

-   implemented and operated on its own; 
-   be compatible and interoperable with all other solutions within the ecosystem; 
-   be deployable in a wide variety of situations; 
-   allow for adaptability in order to best suit the needs of the users; and, 
-   support the development and deployment of new services or capabilities on top of FRAME compliant technologies.

### Intended Users

FRAME is intended to be utilized by governments and organizations that wish to deploy smart-capable solutions in the following scenarios:

-   Severely underdeveloped areas and least developed countries (LDCs);
-   Communities and regions recently impacted by disasters;
-   Remote and harsh environment communities;
-   Temporary communities and camps, such as refugee camps; 
-   Governments responding to crisis situations; and,
-   Other situations where deploying solutions is difficult.

Although FRAME is intended for the above areas, the environment should also be supportive of numerous other situations.

## FRAME Components

FRAME is a smart-community development and innovation kit that provides various components to its users. Components can be considered as the various types of solutions that the environment aims to deliver. Other terms, utilized by other frameworks specific to software development, include “containers” and “kubernetes”. FRAME’s components follow a similar concept. Learn more about the concept of “containers” from a software development perspective at the following links: [https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) and [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/)

## FRAME - Core Concepts

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQGULqLtRlmKbQ/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1619532759930?e=1701907200&v=beta&t=ZI3jMLCuOW7KvcpPl0Q33PCFrRcVWiTBfnUvDiSPgmM)

FRAME is built upon five core concepts that lay out the foundation of the ecosystem. These concepts are meant to guide how FRAME supports communities and the inclusion of technologies within the environment. 

The five concepts are turned into an acronym to create the name of FRAME, these concepts are:

-   **F**unctional
-   **R**apid
-   **A**daptable
-   **M**odular
-   **E**cosystem

The following subsections describe each of these core concepts within FRAME and their importance:

### Functional

Any solution and technology within FRAME should be functional, meaning that the solution should have a specific purpose within any context. All solutions must also be designed and capable of being implemented in a practical and useful manner.

Within FRAME, the term “Functional” refers to the importance that all components available within the ecosystem have a specific purpose. Not only should a component provide some knowable benefit, it must also be capable of describing - in simple terms - what exactly that component does. For example, in terms of power generation, a functional description could be:

**Diesel Power Generator (100kW)**

**_Function:_** _This diesel power generator generates 100 kilowatts of electrical power. Electrical power generation is achieved through the use of diesel fuels in a diesel engine._

Innovation systems benefit best when decision-makers are able to make valuable decisions based on the known function of the components within the system. It allows these decision-makers to understand the purpose of any component, how that component interacts or integrates with other components and what could be achieved by implementing a component.

A functional approach to innovation allows communities to more easily and readily acquire capabilities they do not yet have. This is because the functional approach allows decision-makers to imitate the capabilities that other communities may have and also allows them to more easily benefit from implementing those capabilities. The functional approach supports communities toward investing in the capabilities they need without investing in capabilities that they are not able to support. This greatly enhances the capacity of communities to engage in short-term planning to more easily build solutions for their immediate requirements, while also providing a path towards long-term planning once the community’s immediate requirements are satisfied.

### Rapid

FRAME solutions and technologies must be able to be acquired, deployed, installed or developed rapidly. Given the unique circumstances of the intended users of FRAME, any solution and technology within FRAME should be capable of being utilized and fully implemented within a short timeframe.

Simply put, the communities utilizing FRAME require immediate solutions - either due to a community responding to catastrophes or a requirement to quickly catch up technologically - and these communities cannot afford to wait a long period of time to implement solutions. 

At these early stages in the creation of FRAME, the ecosystem does not yet have a definitive definition of what is meant by rapid and these concepts of speed may be different for different components. For now, it is sufficient to say that components within FRAME must be able to be implemented in any context in a “reasonably quick” fashion. The communities that will be utilizing FRAME may not have the time or capacity to wait excessively long periods when developing or deploying solutions.

There are two significant economic reasons for the requirement that solutions within FRAME are able to be rapidly deployed and both are related to globalization. First, the rapid pace of technological progress in advanced economies creates an unending tide where communities that do not have access to these advancements must face an ever-growing gap to overcome. Second, as the difference in technological progress increases the economic competitiveness of the underdeveloped communities decreases. This means that the rate of growth of this gap also continues to increase, in some cases exponentially. These two circumstances create a “catch-up challenge” for communities. The “catching up” of communities can be supported through innovation systems, such as FRAME, that allows communities to innovate more rapidly or, in some cases, leapfrog into new innovations.

Furthermore, in order for communities to be competitive in the globalized world, communities must be able to innovate rapidly. This means that communities must be able to quickly and rapidly respond to changes in order to survive and prosper. The need to be able to respond quickly is heightened during times of crises.

For these reasons, FRAME ensures that all components and solutions within the ecosystem are capable of being implemented rapidly.

### Adaptable

The solutions and technologies within the FRAME environment must be adaptable to a wide variety of contexts, needs and requirements that could arise. Adaptability ensures that the solutions and technologies are able to be used and modified by the intended users of FRAME.

This adaptability is central to the success of FRAME in supporting innovations and deployment of technology solutions to solve local challenges within communities. The creators of FRAME are strong proponents of the belief that the people within communities are the best suited to overcome challenges faced by them. For this reason, FRAME ensures that users are given the capacity and opportunity to adapt the solutions within FRAME to their own contexts. FRAME also ensures that communities have the access to the information and knowledge needed to implement solutions effectively and in a manner that best suits the requirements of that community.

As quoted above, Hayek strongly believed that a person must be given the capacity to make their own decisions using the knowledge of their circumstances that only that person possesses.  Allowing communities to make the decisions to adapt solutions to their contexts encourages better decision-making and solution development for communities. Importance must be placed on “the knowledge of the particular circumstances of time and place. It is with respect to this that practically every individual has some advantage over all others in that he possesses unique information of which beneficial use might be made, but of which use can be made only if the decisions depending on it are left to him or are made with his active cooperation”.

Adaptability also supports organizations, firms and communities in responding to their unique environments and finding innovative solutions more successfully. Furthermore, a greater level of adaptation capacity within an organization means that an organization is better able to deal with environmental complexities and circumstances. In order to allow for adaptability in a community's or organization’s decision-making, FRAME components are themselves adaptable; if the solutions or components within FRAME were not adaptable, the organizations implementing these components would be limited in their own adaptability.

Components of FRAME must be adaptable; this concept is central to the FRAME ecosystem. It is central not only in the name of FRAME but also in how FRAME is built.

### Modular

All solutions and technologies delivered within FRAME must be modular, such that these components are able to operate independently, while at the same time must be able to interoperate with each other when combined. Modularity ensures that the intended users of FRAME are able to pick and choose which functionality is required without the need to include other superfluous functions.

Modularity of components means that each component can either be: operated autonomously on its own and performing its own function; and, interoperable with other components allowing for a “mix-and-match” of solutions. In other words, modularity means the encapsulation of functions and interdependencies in self-contained units. FRAME calls these encapsulated and self-contained units “components”.

Modularity is important for innovation capacity within an organization, but also in the creation of solutions to meet contextual requirements. Modularity also supports the capacity of organizations to imitate solutions implemented elsewhere and encourages greater economic growth through its capability of improving reusability and benefiting the creation of complex systems.

Importantly, the modularity of FRAME components improves the adaptability, rapidity, cost and quality of the solutions that can be delivered by the ecosystem. This modularity also provides a soft form of structure and coordination - both organizational and technological - to the solutions available within FRAME without compromising the capacity of communities to respond best to their environmental contexts. Ultimately, the modularity of FRAME’s components ensures that communities are best supported in building solutions that suit them best.

### Ecosystem

All components, solutions and technologies within FRAME support the goal of providing a unified innovation framework and ecosystem to support existing technologies. The ecosystem would be open and independent solution providers will be able to make their solutions available to users of FRAME. As an ecosystem, FRAME ensures technologies work together to solve the requirements faced by governments, organizations and communities that are facing difficult situations. 

FRAME envisions itself as an ecosystem of smart-community enabling solutions. The creators believe that FRAME can act as a unified platform that supports communities in overcoming challenges in a way that best benefits the community. Specifically, FRAME is an “innovation ecosystem” as defined by Grandstrand and Holgersson (2020):

_“An innovation ecosystem is the evolving set of actors, activities, and artifacts, and the institutions and relations, including complementary and substitute relations, that are important for the innovative performance of an actor or a population of actors.”_

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQEa-lPInegXZg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/0/1619531252503?e=1701907200&v=beta&t=mnjtxGnBoUttqPR-WeoxRYhecDhXPU0Vl4wEZbgMp0I)

Within this definition, FRAME acts as the institution wherein FRAME sets the “rules of the game” such as the formal and informal rules and constraints of the ecosystem. FRAME provides the structure of the innovation ecosystem in order to reduce uncertainties. Actors within FRAME include the stakeholders such as those described above: Vendors; Users; and, Communities. Within FRAME, we call artifacts the “components of FRAME”; these are the tangible or intangible and physical or virtual technology solutions available within the ecosystem. 

Finally, the activities within FRAME include, but are not limited to: the creation of components within FRAME by vendors; the deployment and adaptation of components within communities by users; and, the end-use of the systems by communities. By viewing FRAME as an “innovation ecosystem” it is easier to conceptualize and illustrate how FRAME can be utilized to support innovation capacities within communities; this document itself is compiled in a similar manner.

FRAME as an innovation ecosystem can bring significant innovation capacities to a wide range of communities in many different contexts.

## Aspects of FRAME

There are a number of aspects of FRAME that—while not being core concepts—are important considerations that apply to the solutions and technologies that fit within the innovation ecosystem.

### Open

Where possible, all solutions within FRAME should be open, transparent and utilize open-source licensing. Commercial systems are welcome within FRAME. However, commercial products should aim to be fully or heavily open-sourced. Open-source technologies provide greater opportunities for users to: better understand how the technology works; modify technologies to better suit the user’s requirements; and, allow users to contribute back into the environment.

### Standardisation and Accreditation

If an existing standard or accrediting body already supports or encourages the concepts within FRAME, those existing standards or accrediting bodies will be utilized. FRAME will not attempt to recreate technology standards and accreditations if a supportive one already exists within the market. Existing standards or accrediting bodies will be used and adopted by the framework as frequently as possible. This will help to eliminate duplication of efforts, increase transparency and further strengthen both FRAME and the standards or accreditations.

### Interoperability

All components within FRAME must be interoperable with other components within the ecosystem. Ensuring the interoperability between components eliminates the need for users of the ecosystem to worry if the components acquired will work together; this will also assist users in reducing the time required to deploy technologies as the interoperability requirements will already be handled. It is expected that the standardization and accreditation of components will help to ensure interoperability.

### Componentisation and Containerisation

All technologies within FRAME are considered components within the ecosystem. Furthermore, each component must be containerized physically or virtually. This means a number of things:

-   Each component is distinct and must be capable of operating on its own without other components of FRAME;
-   Components are containerized virtually or physically so that these technologies can be rapidly transported, deployed and utilized in their intended difficult areas; and,
-   Ensuring that the failure of one component or containerized solution does not disrupt other components.

Of note, and also of importance, the concept of componentization also means that some components are able to “fit within” another component. For example, a cloud hosting and an ICT component may fit within a containerized power generation component. In other words, the hosting and ICT technologies may be housed within the same container as the power generation container.

### Resilience

Due to the harshness and difficulties of the areas within which FRAME is meant to be deployed, all components within the ecosystem must be highly resilient. Resilience within FRAME means that it is difficult to disrupt the operation of the technology, be it intentional, environmental or accidental. Resilience within FRAME also means that in the event of a disruption caused accidentally or intentionally, the functioning of FRAME can be restored quickly. Resiliency can be achieved through physical and virtual safety and security, redundancies of systems, backups of components, “tough” technologies or ease of accessing replacements.

### Documentation, Training and Learning

FRAME components must provide thorough and high-quality documentation. Documentation will also preferably be made available in multiple languages. Furthermore, components should provide an opportunity for training and learning mechanisms for the technologies. Users of FRAME must be able to rapidly learn and “get up to speed” on solutions. Poorly documented technologies without adequate training avenues will not support the users in greatest need.

### Data and Analysis

Many, if not all, of the components within FRAME will produce data. Data and its analysis must be made available to the users of FRAME in an easy to consume and reusable manner. Also, of importance, is data-privacy concerns which should be recognized and supported by all components.

## The Importance of an Inclusive Knowledge Ecosystem

FRAME is a collaborative design process by allowing users to define the right environment around the available resources. FRAME promotes a self-reinforcing collective action and leverages the evolution of social norms. It is well represented by a quote from Ostrom’s (2014) article “_Collective action and the evolution of social norms_”:

_“When the users of a resource design their own rules that are enforced by local users or accountable to them using graduated sanctions that define who has rights to withdraw from the resource and that effectively assign costs proportionate to benefits, collective action and monitoring problems are solved in a reinforcing manner.”_

The knowledge economy creates a new kind of social dynamic that can benefit collaboration. Over the past few decades, new forms of places such as maker spaces, hackerspaces, Living Labs, shared living spaces, FabLabs, and coworking spaces have emerged.  These new forms of spaces, known as the “Fourth Place”, are where _“the frontier between social and private dynamics, work and leisure, networking and social interactions, and collaboration and competition are blurry, making it the place for the knowledge economy”_ (Morisson, 2018). 

FRAME takes advantage of these new social innovation dynamics, proposing physical and virtual hubs on those social intersections. Furthermore, FRAME’s permeability encourages local and global knowledge exchange and diffusion. FRAME does not focus on the diffusion of knowledge or innovations per se, but instead creates the inclusive spaces and conditions that support it.

## Why FRAME Focuses on Smart-Communities

The use of the prefix “smart” to describe a geographical area or a grouping of people, whether a nation or a community, generally implies the use of technology, in particular ICT, to bring about transformative change. Over time, the understanding of “smart cites” and “smart communities” has evolved to factor in issues relating to community participation, collaboration, intellectual exchange, cohesion, and the interactions between other social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors to define and qualify the smart in smart cities, smart communities, etc.

The other crucial aspect when discussing smart communities is one of perspective – smart for who? For example, the use of technology to transform administrative processes to manage, say, public utilities may indeed make the public services more efficient, and hence by some definitions smarter, but if the net impact on the community is that it creates friction and reduces community participation, then it perhaps isn't ‘smart’ from a community’s perspective. To arrive at a more holistic understanding of smart communities, multiple perspectives need to be considered which would include not just technological aspects but also environmental and social considerations.

In this context, we envision FRAME to aid in the rapid development of an open-source, technologically-linked environment that aids in community collaboration, cooperation and participation among various stakeholders from both within and outside the community to achieve desired objectives. Depending on the context, these objectives could either be to provide immediate disaster relief in disaster zones, help in the development of markets among disadvantaged areas, rapidly deploy infrastructure to provide access in remote areas, etc. We imagine the role of digital technologies within this ecosystem to go beyond the reductionist view of technologies simply being used as instruments. Instead, FRAME views technologies as core elements that go towards the creation of an environment that facilitates interaction and collaboration between the various resources and stakeholders. FRAME defines the rules, principles and working relationships of the networked ecosystem, much in line with the Smart Communities logic of networked environments.

In certain contexts, the deployment of FRAME may involve the use of technologies that require interaction amongst themselves as well as with human participants. These socio-technical interactions lead to an added dimension of social intelligence and aids in the development of smart communities, building capacities to tackle emerging societal challenges in ways that would have been impossible a few years ago.

The emphasis, and overarching objective, is on strengthening the capabilities of communities to emerge and develop as smart communities by leveraging the digital and technology-enabled networked environment. The effort is to help communities create an ecosystem that not only helps alleviate the immediate issues and challenges but also helps to develop a model of governance that places the community, and its interests, at the core of its initiatives.

## Using FRAME

FRAME is meant to support the development and deployment of smart-communities in difficult situations. The ecosystem is intended to support: 

-   Vendors and open-source projects that develop, deploy and sell technologies in offering their solutions to governments, organizations and communities that are facing difficult situations;
-   Governments, non-government organizations and communities that are facing difficult situations in researching, acquiring and deploying smart-community enabling solutions offered by vendors and open-source organizations; and,
-   People and citizens living in difficult areas in accessing, utilizing and building upon smart-enabling technologies.

This section describes how the various stakeholders within FRAME are intended to utilize and benefit from the framework. It further describes the environment in which FRAME is provided and the FRAME Catalogue where stakeholders are able to list or acquire FRAME components.

### How FRAME is Utilized

FRAME is utilized differently depending on whether they are technology vendors and open-source projects, end users of FRAME such as governments, non-government organizations and community leaders, or people, citizens and communities who ultimately receive services made possible by the users of FRAME. 

The following table describes how the various stakeholders of FRAME utilize the ecosystem. In the first column, a FRAME name is provided to allow for a unified reference point for that type of stakeholder within FRAME. In the second column, a description of what group of stakeholders is referred to by the FRAME name. In the third column, a brief description of how those stakeholders make use of FRAME.

### FRAME Environment

The FRAME Environment is an envisioned platform where the vendors, users and populace primarily utilize FRAME. This environment would be made available online through a multi-platform application system (web, mobile and desktop) with the capacity for the environment to be downloaded for offline use and a printable version for informational purposes.

![No alt text provided for this image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D12AQHKY7FEzCO_3w/article-inline_image-shrink_1500_2232/0/1619531575169?e=1701907200&v=beta&t=M1dhbQv23xI_O58JvBNm2OVL43Zjhf7RWX8nRfMympo)

How Vendors Use the FRAME Environment

Vendors use the FRAME Environment to learn how to develop technology solutions to work within the FRAME ecosystem. Documentation, instructions and support is provided to vendors to make their technologies deliver upon the FRAME core concepts. The FRAME Environment also provides the instructions and pathways to achieve accreditation for their solutions.

A test environment for FRAME is also anticipated to be made available. In the FRAME Test Environment, vendors will be provided APIs and other interfaces (virtual or physical) to test whether or not their solutions work within the FRAME ecosystem. The test environment will be made freely available to vendors to assist in the development of FRAME compliant solutions. Furthermore, a third-party interface will be made available to support third party verification and testing of FRAME-ready solutions.

How Users Use the FRAME Environment

The FRAME Environment can be thought of as a user-sandbox, allowing for users to learn about how smart-enabling infrastructures and solutions can support their communities. Users can also use the FRAME Environment to virtually build FRAME solutions that support their specific contexts and needs. It is envisioned that FRAME presents users with the ability to input what their specific contexts entails (ie. geographical, cultural, emergencies, known limitations, budgets, timelines, etc.) and the various solutions (ie. ICT, power, servers, etc.) that are required.

Through the FRAME Environment - and by building solutions within this environment - users are able to determine which vendors provide these solutions and technologies. Furthermore, by building a solution within FRAME, the users will be confident that the technologies are already proven to work together, be compatible and understand - via documentation - how to put these solutions to work.

How Communities Uses the FRAME Environment

The FRAME Environment will also provide the capacity for populations and communities that benefit from FRAME accredited technologies to better understand the technologies they are utilizing. The information of the FRAME solutions that are utilized within their communities would be provided openly, with all the various documentation provided to users also provided to the populace. These communities will be able to utilize the FRAME Environment to further build upon the existing solutions in place in order to develop new solutions that best suit their needs.

### FRAME Accreditation

FRAME will provide vendors an accreditation path for technology solutions in order to be able to advertise products or projects as FRAME compliant. Once accredited, FRAME solutions are listed within the FRAME Environment that are made available to users. FRAME accreditation will also be required for solutions built by vendors to be listed in the FRAME Catalogue.

Third-party accreditation will likely be a part of the FRAME accreditation process. Examples of third-party accreditation functions may include:

-   Technology and solution testing by third-parties to ensure unbiased and truthful accreditation; and,
-   Consultation and support through the accreditation process for vendors.

Third-party accreditation organizations may be non-profit or for-profit organizations.

It should be noted that the accreditation path may include already existing accreditations performed by other organizations. Prior to achieving FRAME accreditation, solutions will also be required to achieve accreditation by those organizations. These outside accreditations will be utilized to reduce accreditation overlap, make use of existing expertise in specific accreditation bodies and further strengthen the value of achieving FRAME accreditation. An example of outside accreditation could include electronic and consumer safety accreditations.

### FRAME Catalogue

The FRAME Catalogue will be a function within the FRAME Environment where vendors can list their solutions and users will be able to contact or order solutions from vendors. It will not be mandatory for users or vendors to utilise the catalogue, but it is anticipated that the catalogue will simplify and speed up the process of connecting users with vendors.

Once accredited within FRAME, a vendor will be able to list their solutions within the FRAME Environment. Furthermore, this listing will be included in the FRAME Catalogue so that users will be able to locate, contact and order solutions from vendors.

The FRAME Catalogue will not - in the first phases of developing FRAME - process transactions or payments; it will simply connect users with vendors. In the future, the FRAME Catalogue could be expanded to include additional functions of buying and selling solutions.

## FRAME Foundation

The FRAME Foundation would be a non-profit organization that creates and owns FRAME, including managing and owning all related trademarks and intellectual property. This foundation would be the method of funding the development and operation of the FRAME Environment. Furthermore, the FRAME Foundation would determine the in-depth requirements to meet the FRAME core-concepts, develop the accreditation requirements for vendors and maintain the standards within FRAME. This foundation could be considered similar to other foundations such as the Mozilla Foundation, Apache Software Foundation, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers or Free Software Foundation.

## FRAME’s First Projects

While the possible uses of FRAME are broad, as outlined in this document, the initial projects of focus within the FRAME development kit will enable fully interoperable, modular and containerized infrastructure solutions. At the outset, the FRAME kit will focus on supporting the following five types of smart-community enabling infrastructures:

1.  Power Generation
2.  Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)
3.  Cloud Hosting and Digital Services
4.  Sensors and Internet of Things
5.  Digital Fabrication (FabLab)
